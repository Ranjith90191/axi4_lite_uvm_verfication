## Known Limitations / Future Work

- Reset sequence not yet implemented — reset behavior verification is incomplete (tracked as coverage gap)
- Code coverage target 90% not yet achieved (currently 85.54%) — additional sequences needed to hit unreachable RTL paths
- Byte-enable (WSTRB) partial-write read-back verification can be strengthened with dedicated directed sequence
- No back-pressure stress sequence (READY deasserted mid-transaction) — could add to increase handshake coverage
