## Overview

This project delivers a fully layered **UVM verification environment** for an AXI4-Lite slave IP. The slave implements a register-file peripheral with 32-bit data width, 16 registers (MEM_DEPTH=16), and distinct read-only, write-only, and read/write address regions. The testbench exercises all five AXI4-Lite channels — Write Address, Write Data, Write Response, Read Address, and Read Data — under constrained-random and directed stimulus, verifying correct protocol handshaking, register access permissions, byte-enable behavior, and error response generation (SLVERR/DECERR).

The environment was validated against two RTL variants:
- `axi4_lite_slave_real.sv` — the actual DUT under verification (contains injected/real bugs)
- `axi4_lite_slave.sv` — a reference-clean RTL used to validate testbench correctness

---

## DUT Description

The AXI4-Lite slave is a **register-based peripheral** that communicates over the standard five-channel AXI4-Lite bus. Key DUT properties:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Protocol | AXI4-Lite |
| Data Width | 32 bits |
| Address Width | 32 bits |
| Register Depth | 16 (MEM_DEPTH) |
| Valid Byte Address Range | `0x00` – `0x3F` |
| Address Alignment | Word-aligned (ADDR[1:0] == 2'b00) |
| Clock | ACLK (synchronous) |
| Reset | ARESETn (active-low) |

The slave contains separate **Write FSM** (5-state: W_IDLE → W_BOTH → W_ADDR/W_DATA → W_RESP) and **Read FSM** (2-state: R_IDLE → R_DATA), operating independently to support concurrent read/write transactions. Byte-enable partial-word writes are supported via WSTRB[3:0].

### Error Handling

| Condition | Response |
|---|---|
| Valid aligned write to R/W or W/O region | BRESP = OKAY (2'b00) |
| Write to Read-Only region (0x28–0x30) | BRESP = SLVERR (2'b10) |
| Read from Write-Only region (0x34–0x38) | RRESP = SLVERR (2'b10) |
| Unaligned address (ADDR[1:0] ≠ 2'b00) | BRESP/RRESP = SLVERR (2'b10) |
| Address out of range (> 0x3F) | BRESP/RRESP = DECERR (2'b11) |

---

## Register Map

| Byte Address | Word Index | Access Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 – 0x24 | 0 – 9 | Read/Write | Normal general-purpose registers |
| 0x28 – 0x30 | 10 – 12 | Read-Only | Status registers |
| 0x34 – 0x38 | 13 – 14 | Write-Only | Command registers |
| 0x3C | 15 | Read/Write | Reserved / normal |
| > 0x3F | — | Invalid | DECERR |

---

## Bug Tracking

All bugs found during verification are logged and tracked in [GitHub Issues](../../issues) with severity, root cause, and fix status labels.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Synopsys VCS with UVM 1.2 (`-ntb_opts uvm-1.2`)
- `urg` in PATH (bundled with VCS) — used for coverage report generation
- GNU Make, Bash 4+
- Python 3.x (for `scripts/run_regression.py`)

All commands run from the `sim/` directory.

```bash
cd sim/
```

---

### 1. Compile

Compiles the entire design with line, condition, FSM, branch, and toggle coverage enabled. Automatically recompiles if any `.sv` or `.svh` file in the project changes.

```bash
make compile
```

On success you'll see a green **COMPILE SUCCESS** banner with the top-level module name and CPU time. Errors print a red **COMPILE FAILED** banner with filtered error lines only.

---

### 2. Discover Available Tests

Lists all UVM test classes auto-discovered from `tb/tests/` by scanning for `class X extends *Test*` — no manual test list to maintain.

```bash
make tests
```

Example output:
```
Discovered tests:
   1) axi4l_concurrent_test
   2) axi4l_decerr_test
   3) axi4l_fully_rand_test
   4) axi4l_normal_rw_test
   5) axi4l_ro_test
   6) axi4l_unaligned_test
   7) axi4l_wo_test
   8) axi4l_write_bug_test
   9) axi4l_write_test
  10) axi4l_read_test
```

---

### 3. Run a Single Test

**Interactive mode** — lists tests, prompts for number/name and verbosity:
```bash
make simulate
```

**By index** — run test #4 at default verbosity (UVM_MEDIUM):
```bash
make simulate 4
```

**By index + verbosity**:
```bash
make simulate 4 high
# verbosity options: low | medium | high | full | debug
```

**By name**:
```bash
make simulate axi4l_normal_rw_test high
```

After the run, a green/red banner prints the UVM message summary:
```
--------------------------------------------------
  SIMULATION SUCCESS : axi4l_normal_rw_test
--------------------------------------------------
  UVM_INFO:843  UVM_WARNING:0  UVM_ERROR:0  UVM_FATAL:0
--------------------------------------------------
```

`make sim` is a shorthand alias for `make simulate`.

---

### 4. Regression — Run All Tests + Merge Coverage

`make merge` is the **full regression recipe**. It:
1. Compiles once
2. Runs every auto-discovered test into a **single shared coverage database** (`cov_work.vdb`) so all test contributions are merged correctly by `urg`
3. Generates a merged HTML + text coverage report in `cov_report_merged/`
4. Prints a final pass/fail summary across all tests

```bash
make merge
```

Example output:
```
Running 10 tests into shared coverage db cov_work.vdb...
  -> axi4l_normal_rw_test     PASSED
  -> axi4l_ro_test             PASSED
  -> axi4l_wo_test             PASSED
  -> axi4l_decerr_test         PASSED
  -> axi4l_unaligned_test      PASSED
  -> axi4l_concurrent_test     PASSED
  -> axi4l_fully_rand_test     PASSED
  -> axi4l_write_bug_test      FAILED  (see merge_axi4l_write_bug_test.log)
  ...
--------------------------------------------------
  MERGE COMPLETE
--------------------------------------------------
  Tests run: 10   Passed: 9   Failed: 1
  HTML dashboard : cov_report_merged/dashboard.html
--------------------------------------------------
```

Each failed test generates its own `merge_<testname>.log` for triage.

---

### 5. Single-Test Coverage Report

After running one test (via `make simulate`), generate coverage for that run alone:

```bash
make coverage
```

Report lands in `cov_report/`. To view the HTML dashboard in a browser (file:// won't render the score table correctly):

```bash
cd cov_report && python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
```

---

### 6. Clean

Removes all simulation artifacts, coverage databases, and logs:

```bash
make clean
```

---

### Makefile Target Summary

| Target | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make compile` | Compile RTL + TB with full coverage instrumentation |
| `make tests` | List all auto-discovered UVM test classes |

| `make simulate <N>` | Run test #N from discovered list (UVM_MEDIUM) |
| `make simulate <N> <verb>` | Run test #N with explicit verbosity |
| `make simulate <name> <verb>` | Run test by class name |
| `make sim` | Alias for `make simulate` |
| `make merge` | **Full regression**: run all tests → merge coverage → summary |
| `make coverage` | Generate coverage report from last single-test run |
| `make clean` | Remove all build/sim/coverage artifacts |
